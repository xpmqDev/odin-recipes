    <p>Succulent lobster and crabmeat—plus a splash of white wine—take this mac and cheese to new heights.
        If you&apos;re using frozen lobster tails, let them thaw in the fridge overnight.</p>
    <ul>
        Ingredients:
        <li>12 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) lobster tails, thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>12 ounces shredded Gruyère cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounces Swiss-style processed cheese slices, torn</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 shallot, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can refrigerated lump crabmeat, drained</li>
        <li>2 3/4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can refrigerated lump crabmeat, drained</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay®, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed day-old crusty country bread</li>
        <li>chopped fresh chives, for garnish</li>
        <li>lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        Steps:
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 2 cups cooking water; drain macaroni. Rinse with cold water; drain again.</li>
        <li>Return reserved pasta water to pot; add lobster tails. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and steam until lobster meat is firm and opaque, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer lobster tails to a tray; let cool 2 to 3 minutes. Remove meat and cut into bite-size pieces. Rinse pot. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine Gruyère, Swiss, and flour in a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in the empty pasta pot over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until shallot is softened, about 3 minutes. Gradually add milk and wine; heat just until bubbles form around edge of pot. Gradually whisk in cheese mixture, 1 cup at a time, just until cheese is melted; mixture may not be completely smooth at this point. Remove from heat. Stir in lobster, crabmeat, 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, and pepper. Stir in macaroni.</li>
        <li>Pulse bread cubes in a food processor to get large coarse crumbs. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter; stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning. Add bread crumbs; toss to combine. </li>
        <li>Pour macaroni mixture into prepared baking dish. Top with bread crumb mixture. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly and top is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with chives and additional seafood seasoning. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
